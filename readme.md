<p>
	We are a team of three web developers from Cavite State University, 
	and our goal is to make it easy for students to rate and review the 
	services they receive on campus. With our web app, students can 
	simply scan a QR code to leave their feedback, making it convenient 
	and quick to share their experiences. We believe that by gathering 
	this information, we can not only help the university understand 
	what students think of their services, but also identify areas for 
	improvement. Our ultimate goal is to empower students and help the 
	university provide the best possible experience for all students.
